# DenseNet-Tensorflow
Reimplementation of DenseNet Image Recognition

This is an (re-)implementation of [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) in TensorFlow for Image Recognition on the [ImageNet dataset](http://image-net.org/download-images). The implementation is based on [Tensorflow Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim).
